Final Project for STAD80 - Big Data Analysis at the University of Toronto.

This project included a proposal as to why we chose our research paper, and how were going to go about analyzing it. What questions we had,
how we were going to approach them and answer them, as well as how we were going to conduct analysis on the original authors' work.

The project time-line consisted of roughly 1.5 months during half of which both the Professor and Teaching Assistant (TA) were available.
Due to COVID-19, there immediate, in-person external help was cut short and the final 3 weeks of the project were done completely independantly.
